*Simple, dependency-free tracking for your Firestorm procs, whenever those may be...*

# What does it do?

For reasons that are beyond my comprehension, there is no visual or audio cue for when [Firestorm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333097/firestorm), a [Shadowlands Fire Mage Legendary](https://www.wowhead.com/item=183275/memory-of-the-firestorm), activates.

Without any other dependencies or any necessary set-up, this Addon simply adds a Blizzard-like visual and audio cue to the proc of *Firestorm*.
